## Features

*   **Full Mode Control:** Manage all modes like Auto, Manual (Low, Normal, High), Party, Boost, Away, Holiday, and Stop.
*   **Detailed Sensors:** Read data for temperatures, humidity, fan speeds, heat recovery, and alarms.
*   **Thermostat Control:** Functions as a thermostat to adjust the desired supply air temperature.
*   **Advanced Automation:** Uses Node-RED to automatically adjust fan speed based on humidity and CO2 levels, including a night setback feature.
*   **Custom UI:** A functional Lovelace dashboard built with `custom:button-card` and Mushroom Cards.
*   **Alarm Monitoring:** Displays the status of A, B, C, and filter alarms.

### Installation via HACS (Recommended Method)

While this is not a standard integration, you can add this repository to HACS to easily track updates.

1.  In Home Assistant, navigate to **HACS** -> **Integrations**.
2.  Click the three dots in the top right corner and select **"Custom repositories"**.
3.  In the "Repository" field, paste this URL:
    `https://github.com/Howard0000/ha-systemair-vtr500`
4.  For "Category", select **"Integration"**.
5.  Click **"ADD"**.
6.  The repository will now appear in your HACS integrations list. Click on it and then **"DOWNLOAD"**.
7.  This only downloads the project files. You must still follow the manual configuration steps below to get it working.

## 2. Installation and Configuration

A step-by-step guide to take you from physical installation to a fully automated system.

### Step 2.1: Physical Installation of the Elfin EW11

> **WARNING:** Always disconnect the power to the ventilation unit before opening it. If you are uncertain, consult an electrician.

1.  **Locate the Modbus and Power Port:** On the main board of the VTR-500, find the terminal for external communication, marked `A(+)`, `B(-)`, `24V`, and `GND`.

2.  **Connect the Elfin EW11:** Wire the connections as shown in the diagram below.
    ![Wiring Diagram EW11](image/koblings%20skjema%20EW11.png)
3.  **Restore Power:** Once everything is securely connected, turn the power back on.

### Step 2.2: Configure the Elfin EW11

1.  **Connect to the EW11's Network:** Connect to its Wi-Fi network `EW1x_...` (no password required).
2.  **Open the Web UI:** Go to `http://10.10.100.254`. Log in with `admin` / `admin`.
3.  **Connect to Your Wi-Fi:** Under "System Settings" -> "WiFi Settings", set "Wifi Mode" to "STA", find your home network, enter the password, and save.

4.  **Restart and Find New IP:** The device will restart. Find its new IP address (check your router's DHCP list) and set a static IP for it.
5.  **Configure Serial Port:** Log in to the new IP address. Go to "Serial Port Settings" and apply the settings shown below.
    ![Serial Port Settings EW11](image/serial%20port%20settings%20EW11.png)
6.  **Configure Communication:** Go to "Communication Settings" and add a new profile as shown below.
    ![Communication Settings EW11](image/communication%20settings%20EW11.png)
7.  **Verify:** Go to the "Status" page. The data packet counters should now be increasing, confirming that communication is working.

### Step 2.3: Home Assistant Configuration

1.  **Enable Packages:** Ensure your `configuration.yaml` contains:
    ```yaml
    homeassistant:
      packages: !include_dir_named packages
    ```
2.  **Add the Configuration:** Copy the file `packages/systemair.yaml` from this repository into your `/config/packages/` directory.
3.  **Update IP Address:** Open the `packages/systemair.yaml` file and change the `host` to the static IP address of your Elfin EW11.
4.  **Restart Home Assistant.**

### Step 2.4: Set up the Lovelace Dashboard

This project provides the dashboard configuration in both English and Norwegian.

1.  Choose your preferred language by navigating into either the `lovelace/en/` or `lovelace/no/` folder.
2.  Inside your chosen folder, you will find three YAML files.
3.  On your Home Assistant dashboard, add **three separate "Manual" cards**.
4.  Copy the content from each of the three YAML files into its own "Manual" card.

### Step 2.5: Import the Node-RED Flow

1.  Choose your preferred language. Open the file `node-red/en/flows.json` or `node-red/no/flows.json`. Copy the entire content of the file.
2.  Open Node-RED, go to Menu -> Import, and paste the content.
3.  **IMPORTANT:** Review the new nodes and update the `entity_id`s to match your own humidity and CO2 sensors.
4.  Click "Deploy".

### Bonus: How the Night Setback Works

The Node-RED flow includes a night setback logic to save energy and reduce noise. When activated, it lowers the target temperature by ~3¬∞C and sets the fan speed to "Low".

**Important:** This feature does not activate on its own. It is controlled by a `switch` entity created by the Node-RED flow.
*   If you used the English `flows.json`, the entity is `switch.night_setback_ventilation_on`.
*   If you used the Norwegian `flows.json`, the entity is `switch.nattsenking_ventilasjon_pa`.

To use it, you must create your own automation or script to turn this switch on.
